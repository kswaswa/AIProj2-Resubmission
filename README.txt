Run my program by simply running python2.7 proj2.py.

The graphs will show up, the first one is a graph of the function, the second is a scatter plot for hill climbing. The third graph is a graph of the function, and the fourth is the scatter plot for hill climbing with random restarts. The fifth graph is a graph of the first 100 points of the function (so it would take less time to graph), and the last graph is a scatter plot of the simulated annealing function (limited to 100 points to take less time to graph).

To switch to the next graph click on the red X in the corner (for Macs).
